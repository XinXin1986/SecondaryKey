# EscKey

Add an additional Escape Key on Minecraft Forge 1.19.3+.

Such a feature is useful for people who rebind, for example, Caps Lock to Escape,
as it is a very underutilized key in a rather convenient location.  
This used to work fine on an OS level before 1.19.3,
but has stopped working due to Minecraft no longer using virtual inputs.

This mod once again allows these people, such as myself, to use their muscle memory
by adding a "Secondary Escape" keybind
that closes UIs and opens the pause menu like the real one.
